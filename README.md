# PM — A Search‑First Personal Navigation

PM is a minimalist personal navigation site that replaces the traditional bento.me‑style card grid with a single, powerful search box. Instead of scanning tiles, you simply type what you’re looking for and jump straight to the right destination.

## Why search‑first, not cards?

- __Less visual noise__: One clean input instead of a wall of tiles.
- __Faster access__: Muscle‑memory queries beat hunting for buttons.
- __Scales elegantly__: Adding more links doesn’t clutter the UI.
- __Feels modern__: A focused, glass‑morphism interface with subtle motion and clarity.

## What you can do

- __Find a profile quickly__: Type a platform name (e.g., “Twitter”, “GitHub”) or a keyword.
- __Skim suggestions__: A dropdown shows the top matches with icons, names, and usernames.
- __Jump instantly__: Click a suggestion to open it in a new tab.

## Customizing your links

Your profiles are editable in a simple list so you can make this site truly yours. Add, remove, or rename entries to match your online footprint and personal style.

Suggested fields for each entry:
- __id__: short identifier
- __name__: display name of the platform
- __username__: your handle or label
- __icon__: the platform icon name
- __url__: the link to open

## Design principles

- __Clarity over clutter__: generous spacing, strong alignment, and clear separation.
- __Glass aesthetic__: soft translucency, subtle shadows, and smooth hover states.
- __Consistency__: icons, text, and dividers align to a shared rhythm for calm visuals.

## Roadmap

- Keyboard navigation for the dropdown
- Accessibility/ARIA improvements
- More profile types and icon options
